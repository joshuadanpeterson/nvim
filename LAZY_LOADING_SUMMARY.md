# Completion Stack Lazy Loading Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Consolidated all cmp-related plugins in `autocomplete.lua`
- Moved all completion sources to be dependencies of the main `nvim-cmp` plugin
- Changed the main event from `{ 'InsertEnter', 'CmdlineEnter' }` to just `'InsertEnter'`
- Kept `cmp-cmdline` separate with `CmdlineEnter` event for command-line completion

### 2. Fixed LuaSnip build command
- Commented out `build = 'make install_jsregexp'` to prevent startup execution
- Added a one-time autocmd that checks for jsregexp after the first InsertEnter
- Shows a notification if jsregexp is not installed

### 3. Moved nvim-autopairs
- Removed from `autoformat.lua` 
- Added as a dependency of `nvim-cmp` in `autocomplete.lua`
- This ensures it loads together with the completion stack

### 4. Removed deprecated 'after' syntax
- Consolidated all plugins that used `after = 'nvim-cmp'` as dependencies
- This ensures proper loading order and lazy loading

## Benefits
1. **Faster startup**: All completion plugins now load only when entering insert mode
2. **Cleaner structure**: All completion-related plugins are in one place
3. **No startup builds**: LuaSnip's build command won't run at startup
4. **Proper dependencies**: All plugins load in the correct order

## Testing
To verify lazy loading is working:
1. Start Neovim normally
2. Check `:Lazy` to see plugin status
3. Enter insert mode and check that completion works
4. The first time entering insert mode may have a slight delay as plugins load
